WARNING:tensorflow:From E:\Anaconda3_4.2.0_64bit\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\contrib\learn\python\learn\estimators\head.py:615: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.
